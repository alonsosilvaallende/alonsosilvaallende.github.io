I only recently learned about [Datasette](https://datasette.io/).
My interest came from the possibility to quickly explore a [SQLite database](https://www.sqlite.org/) and I am not disappointed.
You can explore a SQLite database `database.db` as follows:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## uv (ephemeral venv)
```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
uvx datasette database.db
```
## uv (persistent venv)
```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install datasette
datasette database.db
```
## pip
```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install datasette
datasette database.db
```

:::

This will pop up the following in your browser:

We get a nice indication of the title of the dataset, how many rows, and how many tables there are, as well as links to explore the tables. For example, if I click on the link for the table `responses` I get all the rows and columns of that table:

You can also use [Datasette Lite](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite) which runs in browser using WebAssembly and [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) to share your SQLite database and let others to explore it.
For example, by putting a [SQLite database in GitHub](https://github.com/alonsosilvaallende/til/blob/main/posts/2024-11-21-Datasette/logs.db), you can upload it in [https://lite.datasette.io/](https://lite.datasette.io/), and you get a link to explore it in the following [link](https://lite.datasette.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Falonsosilvaallende%2Ftil%2Fmain%2Fposts%2F2024-11-21-Datasette%2Flogs.db#/logs/responses) or directly below:
